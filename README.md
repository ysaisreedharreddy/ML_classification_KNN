K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification Project
This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates the application of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm to predict user purchases based on social network advertisement data. The project is designed to help data science enthusiasts and professionals understand the implementation and evaluation of a KNN classifier using scikit-learn.

Project Features:
Data Preprocessing: Scaling features to normalize distributions which enhances the model performance.
KNN Model: Training a KNN classifier to predict whether a user will purchase a product based on their age and estimated salary.
Performance Evaluation: Using accuracy scores, confusion matrix, and classification reports to evaluate the model.

Dataset:
The dataset, Social_Network_Ads.csv, includes user demographic data like age and estimated salary, alongside their purchasing decisions, making it ideal for binary classification tasks.

Usage:
To run this project, clone the repo and execute the k_nearest_neighbors_practise.py script. Ensure you have Python and necessary libraries installed:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn


Results:
The script outputs:
Model accuracy
Confusion matrix
Classification report detailing precision, recall, and f1-score
